# NER
This case study focuses on Named Entity Recognition (NER) using two approaches: Bi-LSTM + CRF and BERT. The dataset ner_dataset.csv maps each word to its NER tag, ignoring POS tags. Bi-LSTM + CRF captures sequence dependencies, while BERT leverages contextual embeddings for improved accuracy.
